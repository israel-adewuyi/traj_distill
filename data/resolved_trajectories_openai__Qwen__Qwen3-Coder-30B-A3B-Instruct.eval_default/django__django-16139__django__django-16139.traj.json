If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go.

The issue is in the `__init__` method of `UserChangeForm` where it hardcodes `\"../password/\"`. \n\nLooking at the PR description more carefully, the suggestion was to use the instance's pk to construct a proper relative path. However, I need to think about this more carefully. When we're in a to_field scenario, the URL structure changes, but we still need to generate a proper relative path to the password reset form.\n\nIn Django admin, when you access a model through another model's admin with to_field, the URL structure becomes something like:\n`/admin/auth/user/UUID/change/?_to_field=uuid&_popup=1`\n\nAnd the password reset form should be accessible from there. The current hardcoded `\"../password/\"` assumes a certain URL structure that breaks when the to_field parameter is present.\n\nThe proper solution would be to make this path relative to the current form's context. Looking at Django admin patterns, I should probably use a more robust approach that doesn't assume a fixed relative path.\n\nBut let me first understand what the correct path should be. In a normal case, if we're at `/admin/auth/user/123/change/`, the password reset URL should be `/admin/auth/user/123/password/`. When accessed via to_field, we might be at `/admin/auth/user/UUID/change/?_to_field=uuid`, and the password URL should be `/admin/auth/user/UUID/password/`.\n\nActually, looking at the PR description more carefully, it says the fix is to replace with `password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\")`. But this won't work in all cases because `self.instance.pk` might not be available or might not be the right identifier.\n\nLet me think of a better approach. The real issue is that we need to make the path relative to the current admin view context. A better approach would be to use Django's reverse function or construct the path properly.\n\nHowever, given the constraints and the specific issue mentioned, I'll implement the fix as suggested in the PR description, but I'll make sure to handle cases where the instance might not have a pk yet (like during creation).\n</format>\n\n```bash\n# Apply the fix as suggested in the PR description\nsed -i '166s/password.help_text = password.help_text.format(\"..\\/password\\/\")/password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f\"../../{self.instance.pk}\\/password\\/\")/' /testbed/django/contrib/auth/forms.py\n```\n</format>",
