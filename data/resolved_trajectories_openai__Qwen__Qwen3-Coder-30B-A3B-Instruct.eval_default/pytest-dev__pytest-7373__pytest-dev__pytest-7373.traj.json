      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nIncorrect caching of skipif/xfail string condition evaluation\nVersion: pytest 5.4.3, current master\r\n\r\npytest caches the evaluation of the string in e.g. `@pytest.mark.skipif(\"sys.platform == 'win32'\")`. The caching key is only the string itself (see `cached_eval` in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`). However, the evaluation also depends on the item's globals, so the caching can lead to incorrect results. Example:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# test_module_1.py\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nskip = True\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.skipif(\"skip\")\r\ndef test_should_skip():\r\n    assert False\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# test_module_2.py\r\nimport pytest\r\n\r\nskip = False\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.skipif(\"skip\")\r\ndef test_should_not_skip():\r\n    assert False\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `pytest test_module_1.py test_module_2.py`.\r\n\r\nExpected: `test_should_skip` is skipped, `test_should_not_skip` is not skipped.\r\n\r\nActual: both are skipped.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think the most appropriate fix is to simply remove the caching, which I don't think is necessary really, and inline `cached_eval` into `MarkEvaluator._istrue`.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

I identified the problem: The `cached_eval` function in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py` was caching evaluations based only on the expression string, ignoring the globals context that affects evaluation results.\n\n2. I fixed the issue by removing the caching mechanism entirely and inlining the direct evaluation in the `_istrue` method.\n\n3. I verified that the fix works correctly:\n   - When `skip=True` in a module, the test gets skipped (correct)\n   - When `skip=False` in a module, the test does NOT get skipped (correct)\n   - Normal boolean conditions still work properly\n\nThe change I made aligns with the suggestion in the issue description to \"simply remove the caching, which I don't think is necessary really, and inline `cached_eval` into `MarkEvaluator._istrue`.\"\n\nLet me also double-check that I haven't broken any existing tests by running a quick sanity check on the core functionality:\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python -m pytest src/_pytest/mark/ -v -k \"test_\" --tb=short | head -20\n```\n</format_example>",

                "content": "THOUGHT: Let me review what I've done to make sure it fully addresses the issue:\n\n1. I identified the problem: The `cached_eval` function in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py` was caching evaluations based only on the expression string, ignoring the globals context that affects evaluation results.\n\n2. I fixed the issue by removing the caching mechanism entirely and inlining the direct evaluation in the `_istrue` method.\n\n3. I verified that the fix works correctly:\n   - When `skip=True` in a module, the test gets skipped (correct)\n   - When `skip=False` in a module, the test does NOT get skipped (correct)\n   - Normal boolean conditions still work properly\n\nThe change I made aligns with the suggestion in the issue description to \"simply remove the caching, which I don't think is necessary really, and inline `cached_eval` into `MarkEvaluator._istrue`.\"\n\nLet me also double-check that I haven't broken any existing tests by running a quick sanity check on the core functionality:\n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python -m pytest src/_pytest/mark/ -v -k \"test_\" --tb=short | head -20\n```\n</format_example>",
