This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n+    different arithmetic operations.\n+\n+    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n+    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n+    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n+    this behavior.\n+\n+    Examples\n+    --------\n+    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n+\n+        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n+        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n+        ...     pass\n+\n+    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n+\n+        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n+        >>> ndd.add(20)\n+        NDDataWithMath(120)\n+\n+    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n+\n+        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n+        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n+        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n+\n+    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n+\n+        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n+        NDDataWithMath(1)\n+\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    def _arithmetic(\n+        self,\n+        operation,\n+        operand,\n+        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n+        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n+        handle_meta=None,\n+        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n+        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n+        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n+        axis=None,\n+        **kwds,\n+    ):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n+\n+        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n+        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n+        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n+\n+        Parameters\n+        ----------\n+        operation : callable\n+            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.

This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n+    different arithmetic operations.\n+\n+    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n+    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n+    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m.

This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n+    different arithmetic operations.\n+\n+    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n+    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n+    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n+    this behavior.\n+\n+    Examples\n+    --------\n+    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n+\n+        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n+        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n+        ...     pass\n+\n+    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n+\n+        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n+        >>> ndd.add(20)\n+        NDDataWithMath(120)\n+\n+    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n+\n+        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n+        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n+        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n+\n+    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n+\n+        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n+        NDDataWithMath(1)\n+\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    def _arithmetic(\n+        self,\n+        operation,\n+        operand,\n+        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n+        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n+        handle_meta=None,\n+        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n+        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n+        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n+        axis=None,\n+        **kwds,\n+    ):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n+\n+        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n+        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n+        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n+\n+        Parameters\n+        ----------\n+        operation : callable\n+            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.

Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nIn v5.3, NDDataRef mask propagation fails when one of the operand does not have a mask\n### Description\n\nThis applies to v5.3. \r\n\r\nIt looks like when one of the operand does not have a mask, the mask propagation when doing arithmetic, in particular with `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or` fails.  This is not a problem in v5.2.\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about how all that works, but it seems from the error that the operand without a mask is set as a mask of None's and then the bitwise_or tries to operate on an integer and a None and fails.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen one of the operand does not have mask, the mask that exists should just be copied over to the output.  Or whatever was done in that situation in v5.2 where there's no problem.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nThis is with v5.3.   With v5.2, there are no errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> from astropy.nddata import NDDataRef\r\n\r\n>>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0]])\r\n>>> mask = np.array([[0, 1, 64], [8, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]])\r\n\r\n>>> nref_nomask = NDDataRef(array)\r\n>>> nref_mask = NDDataRef(array, mask=mask)\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by constant (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask   # returns nothing, no mask,  OK\r\n\r\n# multiply no mask by itself (no mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_nomask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask # return nothing, no mask, OK\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by constant (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(1., handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by itself (mask * mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_mask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\narray([[ 0,  1, 64],\r\n       [ 8,  0,  1],\r\n       [ 2,  1,  0]])\r\n\r\n# multiply mask by no mask (mask * no mask)\r\n>>> nref_mask.multiply(nref_nomask, handle_mask=np.bitwise_or).mask\r\n...\r\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Versions\n\n>>> import sys; print(\"Python\", sys.version)\r\nPython 3.10.11 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, May 10 2023, 19:07:22) [Clang 14.0.6 ]\r\n>>> import astropy; print(\"astropy\", astropy.__version__)\r\nastropy 5.3\r\n>>> import numpy; print(\"Numpy\", numpy.__version__)\r\nNumpy 1.24.3\r\n>>> import erfa; print(\"pyerfa\", erfa.__version__)\r\npyerfa 2.0.0.3\r\n>>> import scipy; print(\"Scipy\", scipy.__version__)\r\nScipy 1.10.1\r\n>>> import matplotlib; print(\"Matplotlib\", matplotlib.__version__)\r\nMatplotlib 3.7.1\r\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1. Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nCommands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>"

So it goes to the `else` clause and tries to do `handle_mask(self.mask, operand.mask, **kwds)` which becomes `np.bitwise_or(mask_array, None)`\n\nThe fix is to properly check if either mask is None and handle that case appropriately. Looking at the logic, when one operand has no mask, we should return the mask from the operand that has one. Let me fix this:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '485,530s/if (\\(.*\\)) or handle_mask is None:/if (\\1) or handle_mask is None:/' ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\nsed -i '495,500s/elif self.mask is None and operand is not None:/elif self.mask is None and operand is not None and operand.mask is not None:/' ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\nsed -i '500,505s/elif operand is None:/elif operand is None or operand.mask is None:/' ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\nsed -i '505,510s/return deepcopy(operand.mask)/return deepcopy(operand.mask) if operand.mask is not None else deepcopy(self.mask)/' ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\n```\n\nWait, let me be more careful and rewrite the entire function properly:\n\n```bash\nsed -i '485,530d' ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\ncat <<'EOF' >> ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\n    def _arithmetic_mask(self, operation, operand, handle_mask, axis=None, **kwds):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculate the resulting mask.\n\n        This is implemented as the piecewise ``or`` operation if both have a\n        mask.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        operation : callable\n            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin._arithmetic` parameter description.\n            By default, the ``operation`` will be ignored.\n\n        operand : `NDData`-like instance\n            The second operand wrapped in an instance of the same class as\n            self.\n\n        handle_mask : callable\n            see :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`\n\n        kwds :\n            Additional parameters given to ``handle_mask``.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        result_mask : any type\n            If only one mask was present this mask is returned.\n            If neither had a mask ``None`` is returned. Otherwise\n            ``handle_mask`` must create (and copy) the returned mask.\n        \"\"\"\n        # If only one mask is present we need not bother about any type checks\n        if handle_mask is None:\n            return None\n        elif self.mask is None and operand.mask is not None:\n            # Make a copy so there is no reference in the result.\n            return deepcopy(operand.mask)\n        elif self.mask is not None and operand.mask is None:\n            # Make a copy so there is no reference in the result.\n            return deepcopy(self.mask)\n        else:\n            # Both have masks or both are None, so apply the handle_mask function\n            return handle_mask(self.mask, operand.mask, **kwds)\nEOF\n```",

                "content": "Good! The main issue is fixed - the previously failing cases now work. But I still have the issue with cases where both operands have no mask. Looking at the test results, I can see that:\n\n1. \u2705 `multiply(mask, constant)` now works \n2. \u2705 `multiply(mask, no_mask)` now works\n3. \u274c `multiply(no_mask, constant)` fails (both operands have no mask)\n4. \u274c `multiply(no_mask, no_mask)` fails (both operands have no mask)\n5. \u2705 `multiply(mask, mask)` works\n\nThe problem is that when both operands have no mask (both `self.mask` and `operand.mask` are `None`), the code still tries to call `handle_mask(None, None)` which fails. I need to fix this case.\n\nLet me make a simple, clean fix to the existing function:\n\n```bash\n# Let me just make a direct fix to the existing function\n# The issue is in the final else clause - when both masks are None, we shouldn't call handle_mask\n# Let me just replace the problematic lines directly\nsed -i '515s/return handle_mask(self.mask, operand.mask, \\*\\*kwds)/if self.mask is None and operand.mask is None:\\n            return None\\n        else:\\n            return handle_mask(self.mask, operand.mask, \\*\\*kwds)/' ./astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py\n```\n</format_example>",

This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n+    different arithmetic operations.\n+\n+    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n+    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n+    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m.

See\n+    `~astropy.nddata.NDDataArray` for an example.\n+\n+    Notes\n+    -----\n+    This class only aims at covering the most common cases so there are certain\n+    restrictions on the saved attributes::\n+\n+        - ``uncertainty`` : has to be something that has a `NDUncertainty`-like\n+          interface for uncertainty propagation\n+        - ``mask`` : has to be something that can be used by a bitwise ``or``\n+          operation.\n+        - ``wcs`` : has to implement a way of comparing with ``=`` to allow\n+          the operation.\n+\n+    But there is a workaround that allows to disable handling a specific\n+    attribute and to simply set the results attribute to ``None`` or to\n+    copy the existing attribute (and neglecting the other).\n+    For example for uncertainties not representing an `NDUncertainty`-like\n+    interface you can alter the ``propagate_uncertainties`` parameter in\n+    :meth:`NDArithmeticMixin.add`. ``None`` means that the result will have no\n+    uncertainty, ``False`` means it takes the uncertainty of the first operand\n+    (if this does not exist from the second operand) as the result's\n+    uncertainty. This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n+    different arithmetic operations.\n+\n+    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n+    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n+    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m.

This behavior is also explained in the docstring for the\n+    different arithmetic operations.\n+\n+    Decomposing the units is not attempted, mainly due to the internal mechanics\n+    of `~astropy.units.Quantity`, so the resulting data might have units like\n+    ``km/m`` if you divided for example 100km by 5m. So this Mixin has adopted\n+    this behavior.\n+\n+    Examples\n+    --------\n+    Using this Mixin with `~astropy.nddata.NDData`:\n+\n+        >>> from astropy.nddata import NDData, NDArithmeticMixin\n+        >>> class NDDataWithMath(NDArithmeticMixin, NDData):\n+        ...     pass\n+\n+    Using it with one operand on an instance::\n+\n+        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(100)\n+        >>> ndd.add(20)\n+        NDDataWithMath(120)\n+\n+    Using it with two operand on an instance::\n+\n+        >>> ndd = NDDataWithMath(-4)\n+        >>> ndd.divide(1, ndd)\n+        NDDataWithMath(-0.25)\n+\n+    Using it as classmethod requires two operands::\n+\n+        >>> NDDataWithMath.subtract(5, 4)\n+        NDDataWithMath(1)\n+\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    def _arithmetic(\n+        self,\n+        operation,\n+        operand,\n+        propagate_uncertainties=True,\n+        handle_mask=np.logical_or,\n+        handle_meta=None,\n+        uncertainty_correlation=0,\n+        compare_wcs=\"first_found\",\n+        operation_ignores_mask=False,\n+        axis=None,\n+        **kwds,\n+    ):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Base method which calculates the result of the arithmetic operation.\n+\n+        This method determines the result of the arithmetic operation on the\n+        ``data`` including their units and then forwards to other methods\n+        to calculate the other properties for the result (like uncertainty).\n+\n+        Parameters\n+        ----------\n+        operation : callable\n+            The operation that is performed on the `NDData`.
