Looking at the `sqlmigrate.py` file, I can see that the `output_transaction` is only being set based on `migration.atomic`, but according to the issue description, it should also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`. \n\nLet me now look at the exact line that needs to be changed:\n\n```python\n# Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n```\n\nAccording to the issue description, this should be changed to consider both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\nLet me also check what the actual behavior should be by looking at how it's used in the base class:\n\n```bash\ngrep -r \"output_transaction\" --include=\"*.py\" django/core/management/ | head -10\n```\n</format_example>",
